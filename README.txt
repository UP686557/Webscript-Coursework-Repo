To set up the website you will need to do the following.
Open phpmyadmin and copy this code into the SQL insertion tab:

  CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS coursework_db;

You can call the database whatever name you would like but you will need to adjust this in the dbCredentials file after.

Upload all of the files to your chosen server.

once this is completed you will need to navigate to "your domain name/administration/setupDatabase.php" and this will create the tables with a few products already inserted into the product table.

There is an admin section which is not available by hyperlinks.
To get to this you will need to add the extension "/Administration" to the end of url on the top level index page.
